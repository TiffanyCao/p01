    - created a currency.html page and its route for displaying currency exchange rates. The default exchange right now is USD to EUR.
    - wrote a function for a currency exchange rate database that has yet to be tested (the database itself has not been created). The function is meant to
      update an existing exchange rate between a base currency and a desired currency in the database or create an entry for it if the rate has not already been stored.
    - realized there was a more succinct query call for the database, so there are two commits for the function. Also realized there was a mistake in the original
      function so that part was removed
