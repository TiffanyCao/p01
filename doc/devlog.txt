    - created a currency.html page and its route for displaying currency exchange rates. The default exchange right now is USD to EUR.
    - wrote a function for a currency exchange rate database that has yet to be tested (the database itself has not been created). The function is meant to
      update an existing exchange rate between a base currency and a desired currency in the database or create an entry for it if the rate has not already been stored.
    - realized there was a more succinct query call for the database, so there are two commits for the function. Also realized there was a mistake in the original
      function so that part was removed

    - wrote geolocate() function to get information from http request from geolocating API

kiranV -- 2019-11-19 19:19
    - wrote function to get information from REST Countries API
    * again, haven't yet dealt with caching information (although it might not be necessary, no API keys here)

    - added Bootstrap Alerts to display flashed messages, taking advantage of the category argument to change the alert color

    - split addCurrency function into two functions
    - checkCurrency function written: it checks the currency exchange database to see if the base currency and destination currency pair already exists, and returns the rate and
      the timestamp of when it was last updated
    - updateCurrency function written: it either updates the timestamp and exchange rate of an existing pair in the database or adds a new row of the base currency, destination
      currency, rate, and timestamp
    - updated the currency.html page and currency route to reflect this change, but all of this has yet to be tested

kiranV -- 2019-11-19 22:08

    - created a bootstrap navbar in root jinja template, made it look pretty damn nice if i do say so myself
    - made links on navbar change how they display depending on the state of the site: 'New Search' if search term exists already, disabled links when search term does not exist
