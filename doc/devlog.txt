    - wrote base Jinja template for all pages to extend
    - copied basic flask app configuring root route

    - generated coolors.co colorscheme with vacation vibes in mind (see comment in style.css)
    - added basic header, footer to root.html and expanded usage of bootstrap containers
    - created base for landing page out of a bootstrap jumbotron

    - created a currency.html page and its route for displaying currency exchange rates. The default exchange right now is USD to EUR.
    - wrote a function for a currency exchange rate database that has yet to be tested (the database itself has not been created). The function is meant to
      update an existing exchange rate between a base currency and a desired currency in the database or create an entry for it if the rate has not already been stored.
    - realized there was a more succinct query call for the database, so there are two commits for the function. Also realized there was a mistake in the original
      function so that part was removed

    - wrote function to get information from REST Countries API
    * again, haven't yet dealt with caching information (although it might not be necessary, no API keys here)

    - split addCurrency function into two functions
    - checkCurrency function written: it checks the currency exchange database to see if the base currency and destination currency pair already exists, and returns the rate and
      the timestamp of when it was last updated
    - updateCurrency function written: it either updates the timestamp and exchange rate of an existing pair in the database or adds a new row of the base currency, destination
      currency, rate, and timestamp
    - updated the currency.html page and currency route to reflect this change, but all of this has yet to be tested
