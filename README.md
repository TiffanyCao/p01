#### PROGRAM OVERVIEW:

This website is essentially a helping guide to travelers going to other cities or countries globally. There is a single search
form, allowing the users to input a city and country, which will be stored in a session. If the given city and country doesn’t exist, the website will throw an
error message. Using the IP Location API, we can obtain the user’s location, which we can then use to compute the currency exchange, using the Currency Exchange
API. The website will also show information regarding the weather and air quality of the city given using the Dark Sky and Air Visual APIs, respectively. Finally,
using NASA and On Splash, users will be provided with images and a map of the city and/or country they gave. As an extra feature, there will also be a small
section from the Wikipedia API about the city or country given.
